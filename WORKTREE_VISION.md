# Agent-MCP Worktree Integration Vision

## Revolutionary Parallel Development with Git Worktrees

### The Vision: From Single Agent to Development Team

Transform Agent-MCP from "one agent, one task" to "orchestrated development team" using Git worktrees for complete isolation and parallel execution.

## Game-Changing Benefits

### 🚀 **Instant Parallel Development Team**
```bash
# Create specialized agents working simultaneously
create_development_team([
  ("api_expert", "feature/rest-api"),
  ("ui_specialist", "feature/react-frontend"), 
  ("db_architect", "feature/database-schema"),
  ("test_engineer", "feature/integration-tests")
])
# → 4 agents working in parallel, zero conflicts
```

### 🔬 **Risk-Free Innovation Laboratory**
```bash
# Safely experiment with multiple approaches
experiment_with([
  ("conservative_approach", base="main"),
  ("radical_rewrite", base="main"), 
  ("hybrid_solution", base="main")
])
# → Compare 3 implementations simultaneously
# → Keep what works, discard what doesn't
```

### 🤖 **Self-Coordinating Development Ecosystem**
- Agents work together like a real development team
- Cross-worktree awareness and coordination
- Automatic integration testing and merging

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP) 🏗️
**Goal:** Basic worktree isolation with `--git` flag

#### Core Features:
- [ ] `--git` startup flag for advanced users only
- [ ] Basic worktree creation utilities
- [ ] Enhanced `create_agent` with worktree support
- [ ] Simple worktree cleanup on agent termination
- [ ] Worktree status tracking

#### User Experience:
```bash
# Start Agent-MCP with Git worktree support
agent-mcp --git

# Create agent in isolated worktree
create_agent(
    agent_id="feature_worker",
    use_worktree=True,
    branch_name="feature/new-api"
)
```

#### Technical Implementation:
1. **Worktree Utilities** (`agent_mcp/utils/worktree_utils.py`)
   - `create_git_worktree(path, branch, base_branch)`
   - `list_git_worktrees()`
   - `cleanup_git_worktree(path, force=False)`
   - `detect_project_setup_commands(path)`

2. **Enhanced Agent Creation**
   - Extend `create_agent` with worktree parameters
   - Smart session naming: `{agent_id}-{token_suffix}` in worktree
   - Automatic environment setup (npm install, pip install, etc.)

3. **Worktree Tracking**
   - Track agent → worktree mapping in globals
   - Worktree status in `view_status`
   - Cleanup integration with `terminate_agent`

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Create agent in isolated worktree
- [ ] Agent works normally in worktree environment
- [ ] No conflicts between multiple agents
- [ ] Clean worktree cleanup on termination
- [ ] Easy to enable/disable with `--git` flag

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Game-Changing) 🧠
**Goal:** Smart coordination and automation

#### Advanced Features:
- [ ] Cross-worktree awareness
- [ ] Automatic environment detection and setup
- [ ] Intelligent merge strategies
- [ ] Agent coordination protocols

#### User Experience:
```bash
# Agents coordinate automatically
create_coordinated_team([
    ("backend", "feature/api"),
    ("frontend", "feature/ui"),
    ("tests", "feature/testing")
])
```

### Phase 3: Revolutionary (Amazing) 🚀
**Goal:** Complete automated development ecosystem

#### Revolutionary Features:
- [ ] One-command development team creation
- [ ] Automatic integration testing across worktrees
- [ ] Self-managing worktree ecosystem
- [ ] Parallel architecture experimentation

## Technical Architecture

### Worktree Structure
```
project/
├── .git/
├── main-codebase/                    # Original working directory
└── agents/                           # Agent worktrees
    ├── api-expert-def2/              # Agent: api_expert
    │   ├── feature/rest-api          # Branch: feature/rest-api
    │   └── [full project files]
    ├── ui-specialist-def2/           # Agent: ui_specialist

        ├── feature/integration-tests # Branch: feature/integration-tests
        └── [full project files]
```

### Agent Session Integration
- **Session Name:** `{agent_id}-{token_suffix}` (existing pattern)
- **Working Directory:** `../agents/{agent_id}-{token_suffix}/`
- **Branch:** `agent/{agent_id}` or user-specified
- **Tmux Session:** Runs in worktree directory with proper environment

### Configuration Schema
```python
class WorktreeConfig:
    enabled: bool = False                     # Enable worktree mode
    branch_name: Optional[str] = None         # Auto-gen: agent/{agent_id}
    base_branch: str = "main"                # Branch to base from
    cleanup_strategy: str = "on_terminate"   # Cleanup behavior
    auto_setup: bool = True                  # Run setup commands
    setup_commands: List[str] = []           # Custom setup commands
```

   - Error messages and debugging
   - Advanced user workflows

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets:
- [ ] **Isolation:** Multiple agents work without conflicts
- [ ] **Stability:** No crashes or data loss
- [ ] **Performance:** Worktree creation < 30 seconds
- [ ] **Usability:** Clear documentation and error messages
- [ ] **Safety:** Robust cleanup, no orphaned resources

### Long-term Vision:
- **10x Productivity:** Parallel development instead of sequential
- **Zero Risk:** Experiment without fear of breaking main
- **Team Coordination:** Agents work together intelligently
- **Effortless Scaling:** Add more agents instantly

## Getting Started (Phase 1)

### For Developers:
```bash
# Enable experimental worktree features
agent-mcp --git

# Create your first worktree agent
create_agent(
    agent_id="test_worker",
    use_worktree=True,
    branch_name="feature/test-worktrees"
)

# Verify isolation - create another agent
create_agent(
    agent_id="another_worker", 
    use_worktree=True,
    branch_name="feature/another-test"
)

# Both agents work in complete isolation!
```

### Safety First:
- Hidden behind `--git` flag for advanced users
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Clear documentation and warnings
- Extensive testing before general availability
