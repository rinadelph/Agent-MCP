# Contributing to Agent-MCP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Agent-MCP! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our multi-agent collaboration framework.

## üéØ Project Overview

Agent-MCP is a sophisticated multi-agent collaboration system built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our goal is to enable multiple AI agents to work together efficiently on software development tasks through shared memory, coordinated task management, and real-time visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+** with pip or uv
- **Node.js 18.0.0+** (recommended: 22.16.0)
- **npm 9.0.0+** (recommended: 10.9.2)
- **OpenAI API key** for embeddings and RAG
- **Claude Code or Cursor** for AI-assisted development

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Agent-MCP.git
   cd Agent-MCP
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Python dependencies
   uv venv && uv pip install -e .
   
   # Dashboard dependencies
   cd agent_mcp/dashboard
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your OpenAI API key to .env
   ```

4. **Setup Claude Code Hooks** (Important for multi-agent development)
   ```bash
   ./setup-claude-hooks.sh
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest
   
   # Start server
   uv run -m agent_mcp.cli --project-dir .
   
   # Start dashboard (in new terminal)
   cd agent_mcp/dashboard && npm run dev
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `feature/your-feature-name` - New features
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/improvement-description` - Documentation updates

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Development Guidelines**
   - Follow existing code style and patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Use the multi-agent workflow when possible (see below)

3. **Multi-Agent Development** (Recommended)
   - Use Agent-MCP itself for development
   - Create specialized agents for different tasks
   - Follow the MCD (Main Context Document) approach
   - Document your multi-agent workflow in commit messages

### Code Style

**Python Code:**
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Run `rye run lint` and `rye run format` before committing

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Follow existing patterns in the dashboard
- Run `npm run lint` in the dashboard directory

**Testing:**
- Write pytest tests with real objects (no mocking)
- Use function-style tests instead of class-style
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### Commit Guidelines

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Examples:
  - `feat(tools): add new file locking mechanism`
  - `fix(hooks): resolve Claude Code hook path issues`
  - `docs(setup): add hook configuration instructions`

## üêõ Reporting Issues

## üìö Development Resources

### Key Architecture Components
- **MCP Server** (`agent_mcp/app/`) - Core protocol implementation
- **Tools Registry** (`agent_mcp/tools/`) - Modular tool system
- **RAG System** (`agent_mcp/features/rag/`) - Context management
- **Dashboard** (`agent_mcp/dashboard/`) - Real-time visualization
- **Hooks** (`agent_mcp/hooks/`) - File locking and coordination

### Important Concepts
- **Short-lived agents** with persistent shared memory

- **File-level locking** for conflict prevention
- **RAG-based context** sharing between agents

### Testing Philosophy
- Real objects over mocks for integration testing
- Function-style tests for clarity
- Test multi-agent scenarios when possible
- Verify hook functionality in test environments
