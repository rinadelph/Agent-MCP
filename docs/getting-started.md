## ⚡ Quick Install (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rinadelph/Agent-MCP.git
cd Agent-MCP

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key

# Install dependencies
uv venv && uv pip install -e .

# Configure Claude Code hooks for multi-agent file locking
./setup-claude-hooks.sh
```

### 2. Start MCP Server
```bash
# Start the MCP server (replace with your project path)
uv run -m agent_mcp.cli --project-dir /path/to/your/project

# You'll see output like:
# 🤖 Admin Token: abc123def456...
# 📡 Server running on http://localhost:8080
# 📊 Dashboard: Start with 'cd agent_mcp/dashboard && npm run dev'
```

### 3. Configure Multi-Agent File Locking

Agent-MCP requires Claude Code hooks for proper multi-agent coordination. The setup script configures these automatically:

```bash
# If you missed it in step 1, run:
./setup-claude-hooks.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Configures PreToolUse hooks to check file locks before editing
- Configures PostToolUse hooks to log activity and release locks
- Creates necessary directories (`.agent-locks`, `.agent-activity`)
- Prevents file conflicts when multiple agents work simultaneously

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see "MODULE_NOT_FOUND" errors when editing files, the hooks aren't configured properly
- Run the setup script again: `./setup-claude-hooks.sh`
- Ensure you're running Claude Code from the Agent-MCP project root directory

### 4. Launch Dashboard (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd agent_mcp/dashboard
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev

# Dashboard available at http://localhost:3847
```

### 5. Connect AI Assistant
**For Claude Code**, add to your `mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Agent-MCP": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**🎉 You're ready!** The server is running and your AI assistant can connect.

## 🎯 Your First Multi-Agent Project

Let's build a simple task management system to demonstrate Agent-MCP's capabilities.

### Step 1: Create Your Project Directory
```bash
mkdir my-task-manager
cd my-task-manager

# Initialize basic structure
touch README.md
mkdir src docs tests
```

### Step 2: Create Your First MCD

Create `MCD.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# Task Manager MCD

## 🎯 Overview & Goals  
**Project Vision**: Build a simple task management web application where users can create, update, and delete tasks with a clean, responsive interface.

**Target Users**: Individual users who need a simple, distraction-free task tracker

**Core Features**: 
1. Create tasks with title and description
2. Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
3. Delete tasks
4. Responsive web interface
5. Local storage persistence

**Success Criteria**: 
- Users can add a task in under 5 seconds
- Task status updates are immediate
- Interface works on mobile and desktop
- No data loss on page refresh

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
**Frontend**:

## 📋 Detailed Implementation

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Task object structure
interface Task {
  id: string;          // UUID for unique identification
  title: string;       // Required, max 100 characters
  description: string; // Optional, max 500 characters  
  completed: boolean;  // Task completion status
  createdAt: Date;     // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;     // Last modification timestamp
}

// Storage structure
const tasks = []; // Array of Task objects in localStorage
```

### Core Functions
```javascript
// Required functions to implement
function createTask(title, description) { }
function updateTask(id, updates) { }
function deleteTask(id) { }
function toggleTaskComplete(id) { }
function loadTasks() { }
function saveTasks() { }
function renderTasks() { }
```

### HTML Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Task Manager</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
</head>

## ✅ Task Breakdown & Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Structure (30 minutes)
**1.1 HTML Foundation**
- Create semantic HTML structure with proper accessibility
- Include meta tags for responsive design
- **Acceptance**: HTML validates and displays correctly

**1.2 CSS Styling**
- Implement responsive layout with Flexbox
- Create clean, modern styling with good contrast
- **Acceptance**: Interface looks good on mobile and desktop

### Phase 2: JavaScript Functionality (45 minutes)
**2.1 Data Management**
- Implement localStorage utilities for data persistence
- Create task CRUD operations
- **Acceptance**: Tasks persist across page refreshes

**2.2 User Interface**
- Implement task creation form handling
- Create dynamic task list rendering
- Add task completion toggle functionality
- **Acceptance**: All core features work without errors

### Phase 3: Polish (15 minutes)
**3.1 User Experience**
- Add form validation and user feedback
- Implement keyboard shortcuts (Enter to add task)
- **Acceptance**: Interface is intuitive and responsive

## 🔗 Integration & Dependencies
**Internal Dependencies**: 
- app.js depends on storage.js and utils.js
- All JS files depend on DOM structure in index.html

**External Dependencies**: 
- None (vanilla JavaScript only)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation Strategy
**Manual Testing**:
- Create task and verify it appears
- Mark task complete and verify status change
- Delete task and verify removal
- Refresh page and verify persistence
- Test on mobile device for responsiveness

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- Data persists across browser sessions
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Interface is fully responsive
```

### Step 3: Initialize Admin Agent

In your AI assistant (Claude Code/Cursor), use your admin token:

```
You are the admin agent for the Task Manager project.
Admin Token: "your_admin_token_from_server_startup"

TASK: Add the entire MCD to project context - every detail, don't summarize anything.

[Paste your complete MCD here]

After adding context, create a worker agent to start implementation.
```

### Step 4: Create Worker Agent

When the admin agent creates a worker, initialize it in a new window:

```
You are frontend-worker agent.
Your Admin Token: "worker_token_from_admin_response"

Look at your assigned tasks and ask the project RAG agent 5-7 critical questions to understand:
- What exactly needs to be implemented
- What file structure to use  
- How the task management functionality should work

Think critically about each question before asking.

AUTO --worker --memory
```

### Step 5: Watch the Magic Happen

The worker agent will:
1. ✅ Query the project RAG for context
2. ✅ Review its assigned tasks  
3. ✅ Create the HTML structure
4. ✅ Implement CSS styling
5. ✅ Build JavaScript functionality
6. ✅ Test the implementation
7. ✅ Update task status and document progress

### Step 6: Review and Iterate

Use the dashboard to:
- 📊 Monitor agent progress in real-time
- 📋 Track task completion
- 🧠 View project context and agent communications
- 🔍 Debug any issues that arise

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ❌ "Cannot find admin token"
**Solution**: Check the MCP server startup logs in your terminal. The token is displayed when the server starts.

### ❌ "Agent can't access project context"  
**Solution**: Make sure the admin agent successfully added the MCD to project context. Check the dashboard's Memory section.

### ❌ "Worker agent doesn't understand tasks"
**Solution**: Your MCD might be too vague. Add more specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.

### ❌ "Agents are not coordinating"
**Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct tokens (admin vs worker) and that the --worker flag is included in worker initialization.

### ❌ "Dashboard won't load"
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Check Node.js version (needs 18+)
node --version  

# Reinstall dependencies in dashboard directory
cd agent_mcp/dashboard
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### ❌ "MCP server connection failed"
**Solution**: Verify the server is running on the correct port and that your AI assistant can reach `http://localhost:8080/sse`.
