## Executive Summary

The Beverly Knits AI Supply Chain Optimization Planner is a purpose-built, weekly operational solution designed to transform how raw material procurement is managed within our textile manufacturing ecosystem. Leveraging advanced AI-driven forecasting algorithms‚Äîincluding time series models (ARIMA, Prophet), machine learning regressors, and ensemble approaches‚Äîthe system consolidates demand signals from our ERP and external forecasting tools to produce precise, cost-effective order recommendations. Key differentiators include dynamic safety stock adjustment, MOQ optimization, and real-time supplier risk scoring, all delivered via an intuitive Streamlit dashboard with audit trails and rationale summaries for C-level transparency.

## Intended Audience

- **Primary:**
  - Supply Chain Managers responsible for executing procurement cycles, monitoring inventory health, and ensuring on-time material availability.
- **Secondary:**
  - C‚ÄëSuite Executives (CEO, CFO, COO) overseeing strategic cost management, capital allocation, and AI ROI.
  - IT & ERP Teams tasked with integration, data governance, and infrastructure support.
  - External Partners (selected suppliers or consultants) may receive summarized excerpts for collaboration purposes.

## System Overview

The Planner automates a six-phase weekly cycle:

1. **Forecast Unification:**
   - Ingests raw sales orders, pipeline entries, and external market forecasts.
   - Applies source reliability weights, bias correction, and outlier detection.
2. **BOM Explosion:**
   - Maps SKU-level forecasts to constituent yarns/fibers using the latest BOMs.
   - Handles variant BOMs (e.g., dyed vs. greige) with conditional logic.
3. **Inventory Netting:**
   - Reconcil es on-hand stock and open purchase orders.
   - Flags negative or stale inventory feeds and auto-corrects anomalies.
4. **Procurement Optimization:**
   - Calculates EOQ considering holding costs, lead times, and risk premiums.
   - Dynamically adjusts safety stock based on forecast error distributions.
   - Enforces supplier-specific MOQ and volume discount tiers.
5. **Supplier Selection:**
   - Scores each supplier on cost, historical lead-time adherence, reliability, and financial health indicators.
   - Provides alternative sourcing suggestions in case of single-source dependencies.
6. **Recommendation Output:**
   - Generates detailed order proposals, comparing baseline vs. optimized scenarios.
   - Exports actionable order sheets (CSV, XLSX) and KPI dashboards.
