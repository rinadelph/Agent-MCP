1. Overview & Goals
Objective: Develop a centralized Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform providing content creators and clipping specialists with access to raw video segments from major streaming platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube initially) and sophisticated, real-time analytics on clip trends, creator performance, and content engagement, functioning as an intelligence hub analogous to a "Bloomberg Terminal for viral clips".  
Scope:
In Scope: Core web application (user auth, subscriptions, payments), data ingestion from TikTok/Instagram/YouTube APIs , focus on "Brain Rot"  style content niches, raw clip discovery/download, Creator CRM dashboard (authenticated data), analytics dashboard ("Bloomberg" view), external API (read-access initially), VPS-based infrastructure.  
Out of Scope (Initial): User uploading/hosting of edited clips, in-platform video editing, advanced predictive modeling, direct editing software integration, support for platforms beyond the initial three, features reliant on data not reliably accessible via official APIs.
Success Criteria:
Achieve target user acquisition and retention metrics.
Maintain high data accuracy and low latency in analytics reporting (< X ms target).
Positive user feedback scores (> Y on usability/value surveys).
Maintain compliance with platform API terms of service.   
Demonstrate stable external API adoption (target Z active integrations).
2. Context & Architecture
Overall System Context: This platform is a standalone SaaS application. It interacts externally with social media platform APIs (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) for data ingestion and potentially with payment gateways. Internally, it comprises distinct modules for frontend UI, backend API services, data processing, analytics, and database management. It does not directly depend on other pre-existing internal MCDs at this stage. **Crucially, authentication and API interactions with external platforms will rely on user-provided developer credentials (Client ID/Secret) stored securely in the database.**

*(Diagram Explanation): The diagram shows the user interacting with the Frontend UI, which communicates with the Backend API Gateway. The Backend orchestrates calls to various internal services (Auth, Ingestion, Processing, Analytics) and external services (Platform APIs, Payment Gateway). Data flows from external APIs via the Ingestion service into the Databases, is processed by the Video Processing and Analytics Engines, and results are served back through the Backend API to the Frontend or the External API Gateway.* **OAuth flows and data ingestion rely on fetching and using the specific user's stored developer credentials (Client ID/Secret) from the Databases (`platform_accounts`) to interact with external APIs.**
Technology Stack: (Potential - TBD)
Hosting: VPS (e.g., AWS Lightsail, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Compute Engine) , Linux OS.   
Backend: Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js (Express).

4. Design Specification
4.1. UI/UX Design (Frontend):
Wireframes/Mockups: (To Be Created - Link/Description Placeholder). Initial designs should focus on clarity, data density (for analytics), and workflow efficiency for clip selection. Inspiration from financial terminals  and social media analytics tools [25-33].   
UI Components (Conceptual): LoginForm, RegistrationForm, SubscriptionSelector, AccountLinker, CreatorSearch, VODList, VODPlayerInterface (with timeline selection), ClipDownloadButton, AnalyticsDashboard, AnalyticsChart (Line, Bar), AnalyticsTable, CRMDashboard, CRMMetricsDisplay, APIManagementPanel.
Styling Notes: Utilize a consistent design system (e.g., Material UI, Tailwind CSS). Prioritize responsive design for desktop browsers. Ensure clear data visualization principles are followed for charts and graphs.
4.2. API Design (Backend/Shared):
Approach: Primarily RESTful APIs for internal frontend-backend communication and external access.

StreamVODs: Stores metadata for indexed streams/VODs.
RawClipRequests: Tracks user requests for raw clip downloads (status, timestamps, segment info).
AnalyticsDataPoints: Stores time-series data for analytics metrics.
PlatformAccounts: Securely stores **user-provided developer Client ID/Secret (encrypted)** AND resulting user platform credentials (tokens, scopes, encrypted).
Subscriptions: Manages user subscription plans and billing cycles.
4.4. Logic & Flow:
Core Logic Areas: Data Ingestion (**fetching user credentials from DB first**, API polling, error handling, token refresh), Raw Clip Extraction (validation, VOD retrieval, segmentation, secure storage), Analytics Engine (metric calculation, trend identification, aggregation), Monetization Enforcement (subscription/credit checks), Authorization/Authentication (**OAuth flows using user-provided credentials fetched from DB**, API key validation, access control).
Raw Clip Extraction Workflow (Sequence Diagram):

9. Agent Instructions & Considerations
Processing Order: Implement Units sequentially following the Phased Rollout plan (Phase 1 first: Units 1-4, then Phase 2, etc.). Within a phase, some parallel work might be possible (e.g., frontend/backend for a feature), but ensure backend APIs are ready before frontend integration.
File Locking: Use check file status before modifying files, especially if multiple agents/developers might work concurrently (less likely in early phases but good practice).
Assistance/Partitioning: Complex areas requiring careful implementation or potential assistance requests include:
Navigating specific platform API intricacies, authentication, and rate limits.   
Efficient video processing pipeline for raw clip extraction.
Scalable design of the analytics engine and database queries.
Secure implementation of payment gateway integration.
Code Style: Adhere to established project linting (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) and formatting rules. Follow consistent naming conventions and commenting practices.
*   **System Architecture**: Describe the high-level architecture (SaaS, Modules, Data Flow) including **Supabase, Vault, and external API interactions using user-provided credentials.**
*   The platform will **securely store user-provided developer credentials (Client ID/Secret) using Supabase Vault** and utilize these for accessing external platform APIs on the user's behalf.
*(Diagram Explanation): User interacts with React/HeroUI Frontend, using Supabase SDK for Auth/DB (with RLS). Frontend calls Backend API (VPS/Functions) for complex tasks (ingestion, video processing, heavy analytics, external API). Backend uses Supabase DB/Auth, **securely retrieving user credentials from Vault when needed**. Data ingestion pulls from external APIs into Supabase DB. Note the distinction between data accessed via user OAuth (Authenticated Path for CRM) and data sourced publicly (Public Path for "Bloomberg" view).** OAuth flows and data ingestion rely on fetching and securely decrypting the specific user's developer credentials (Client ID/Secret) from Supabase Vault via references in `platform_accounts` to interact with external APIs.** Public Path for "Bloomberg" view (which may still use platform-level API keys if accessing purely public, non-user-specific data).*
*   **User-Provided Credentials:** Client ID and Client Secret obtained by the end-user from registering their *own* developer application with an external platform (e.g., TikTok). Stored securely **via Supabase Vault**, with references stored in the `platform_accounts` table.
*   **Supabase Vault:** Supabase's secure secret management service.
*   **2.2 User Story:** As a creator user, I want to securely provide and update the Client ID and Client Secret for my developer application for each external platform (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) via the Account Settings page.
*   **2.3 Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Input fields for Client ID and Secret are available for each supported platform in the user's account settings.
    *   On submission, credentials are **validated (if possible) and securely stored via Supabase Vault.**
    *   The `platform_accounts` table is updated with the **Vault secret reference (UUID)** and a status of 'pending validation'.
    *   User receives confirmation of successful storage.
    *   UI displays the status (e.g., 'pending', 'valid', 'invalid') of the stored credentials.
*   **3.2 User Story:** As a creator user, I want to connect my TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube accounts via OAuth, **which uses my previously provided developer credentials (retrieved securely from Vault)**, so the platform can fetch my performance data.
*   **3.3 Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   'Connect' button for each platform initiates the standard OAuth 2.0 flow.
    *   The backend uses the **user's stored (and Vault-retrieved) developer credentials** to make the necessary OAuth requests.
    *   Upon successful authorization, the platform securely stores the resulting access and refresh tokens **(potentially also in Vault)**, linking them to the user and the specific `platform_accounts` entry.
    *   The connection status is updated and displayed in the UI (e.g., 'Connected', 'Disconnected').
    *   User can disconnect the account, which revokes tokens and updates the status.
POST /api/credentials/{platform}
*   Description: Securely stores user-provided developer credentials **using Supabase Vault**.
*   Auth: Required (User JWT)
*   Request Body: `{ "client_id": "string", "client_secret": "string" }`
*   Response (Success): `{ "status": "pending_validation", "vault_secret_id": "uuid" }`
*   Response (Error): Standard error format.
GET /api/credentials/status
*   Description: Retrieves the validation status of stored credentials for the user.
*   Auth: Required (User JWT)
*   Response (Success): `{ "platform": "tiktok", "status": "valid" }, { "platform": "youtube", "status": "invalid", "reason": "API error..." } ]`
*   `platform_accounts`
    *   `id` (uuid, pk)
    *   `user_id` (uuid, fk -> auth.users)
    *   `platform_name` (text, e.g., 'tiktok', 'youtube')
    *   `developer_credentials_vault_id` (uuid, **Reference to the secret in vault.secrets containing client_id/secret**)
    *   `access_token_vault_id` (uuid, nullable, **Reference to the secret in vault.secrets containing access token**)
    *   `refresh_token_vault_id` (uuid, nullable, **Reference to the secret in vault.secrets containing refresh token**)
    *   `scopes` (text[], nullable)
    *   `status` (text, e.g., 'pending_validation', 'valid', 'invalid', 'connected', 'disconnected')
    *   `last_validated_at` (timestampz, nullable)
    *   `created_at` (timestampz)
    *   `updated_at` (timestampz)
*   **Data Ingestion Flow:**
    1.  Scheduler (e.g., Supabase Cron Job) triggers ingestion for a user/platform.
    2.  Backend service retrieves the `platform_accounts` record for the user/platform.
    3.  **Retrieves necessary tokens/credentials from Supabase Vault using the stored UUIDs.**
    4.  Makes requests to the external platform API using the retrieved credentials/tokens.
    5.  Handles token refresh if necessary (**updating the token secret in Vault**).
    6.  Processes the API response.
    7.  Stores relevant data points in Supabase tables (e.g., `analytics_reports`).
    8.  Handles errors (API errors, rate limits, invalid credentials - updating `platform_accounts.status`).
*   **Credential Validation Flow:**
    1.  User submits credentials via `POST /api/credentials/{platform}`.
    2.  Backend securely stores credentials in **Supabase Vault**.
    3.  Creates/updates `platform_accounts` record with Vault reference and 'pending_validation' status.
    4.  (Optional/Platform-Dependent) A background job attempts a simple API call (e.g., get app details) using the stored credentials (retrieved from Vault) to validate them.
    5.  Updates `platform_accounts.status` to 'valid' or 'invalid' based on the validation attempt.
*   **OAuth Connection Flow:**
    1.  User clicks 'Connect' in Frontend UI.
    2.  Frontend redirects to `GET /api/auth/link/{platform}`.
    3.  Backend retrieves the **user's developer credentials from Vault** using the reference in `platform_accounts`.
    4.  Backend constructs the platform's OAuth authorization URL using the retrieved credentials and redirects the user.
    5.  User authorizes on the platform site.
    6.  Platform redirects back to the configured callback URL (`/api/auth/callback/{platform}`).
    7.  Backend callback handler receives the authorization code.
    8.  Backend exchanges the code for access/refresh tokens using the **user's developer credentials (retrieved from Vault)**.
    9.  Backend securely stores the tokens **(likely in Vault)** and updates the `platform_accounts` record (Vault references, status='connected', scopes).
