
 my goal is for the software to be able to analyze historical sales and forecast then compare these to current inventory levels and identfy ares where there is a risk of running out of stock. From these inventory levels i want it to then calculatue the amount of yarn that will be needed in production. I then want it to compare the yarn comsumption to yarn inventory levels to identify shortages.
