# Agent-MCP/mcp_template/mcp_server_src/tools/__init__.py

"""
Tools Package Initialization for MCP Server.

This __init__.py file serves to import all individual tool modules.
Importing these modules will trigger their respective registration functions
(e.g., `register_admin_tools()`, `register_task_tools()`, etc.), which in turn
call `register_tool()` from `mcp_server_src.tools.registry`. This populates
the central tool schemas and implementations in the registry.

The order of imports here generally doesn't matter for the registration itself,
as long as `mcp_server_src.tools.registry` is loaded before or during these imports.

# For example, if other parts of the application need direct access to these:
# from .registry import list_available_tools, dispatch_tool_call
# This makes them available as `from mcp_server_src.tools import list_available_tools`

# For now, other modules will import directly from .registry if needed.
