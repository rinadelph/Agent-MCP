## Dashboard Navigation Tabs

The dashboard includes multiple tabs for different functional areas:

1. **üìä Executive Dashboard** - Main KPIs and overview
2. **üéØ 6-Phase Planning** - Integrated planning engine
3. **ü§ñ ML Forecasting** - Machine learning predictions
4. **‚ö° Advanced Optimization** - Supply chain optimization
5. **üè≠ Supplier Intelligence** - Supplier analytics and scoring
6. **üîÑ Production Pipeline** - Production tracking
7. **üìà Executive Insights** - Strategic insights

## Potential Obsolete Files

Based on the directory listing, these files might be older versions or alternatives:

### Potentially Redundant Files:
1. **beverly_app.py** - Likely an older version
2. **beverly_app_fixed.py** - Appears to be a bug fix version, now obsolete
3. **beverly_erp_v2.py** - Previous version, superseded by comprehensive_erp
4. **textile_erp_demo.py** - Demo version, not production
5. **run_beverly_knits.py** - Might be a launcher script

### Specialized Components (Still Active):
1. **beverly_analytics_erp.py** - Analytics-specific module
2. **beverly_agent_launcher.py** - Agent system launcher
3. **beverly_agent_monitor.py** - Agent monitoring system
4. **textile_inventory_forecasting.py** - Specialized forecasting module

## Data Integration

The system properly loads data from:
- **Path**: `ERP Data/New folder/`
- **Files**: BOM, Sales, Yarn Inventory, Fabric Inventory
- **Legacy Support**: Handles `yarn_inventory (1).xlsx` for backward compatibility

## Feature Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Features:
1. **Multi-level BOM explosion** with percentage-based calculations
2. **ML forecasting** with ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Prophet)
3. **Dynamic EOQ** calculations with carrying cost optimization
4. **Supplier risk scoring** with multi-factor assessment
5. **Safety stock optimization** using statistical methods
6. **Production pipeline** management with capacity planning
7. **Emergency procurement** detection and alerts
8. **6-Phase Planning Engine** integration
9. **Real-time KPI dashboards** with interactive visualizations
10. **Multi-channel notifications** (configured but implementation depends on setup)

### ‚úÖ No Obsolete Code Found:
- No references to older files within the code
- No deprecated imports or functions
- Clean implementation with proper error handling
- Modern async/await patterns where applicable

## Recommendations

1. **Archive Old Files**: Move `beverly_app.py`, `beverly_app_fixed.py`, and `beverly_erp_v2.py` to an archive folder
2. **Keep Specialized Modules**: Maintain analytics, agent, and forecasting modules as they serve specific purposes
3. **Documentation**: Update README to clarify that `beverly_comprehensive_erp.py` is the main entry point
4. **Cleanup**: Remove demo files from production environment

## Conclusion

The `beverly_comprehensive_erp.py` file is the **current, active dashboard** with all features properly routed and no dependencies on older implementations. The system is well-structured with clear separation of concerns and modern implementation patterns.
